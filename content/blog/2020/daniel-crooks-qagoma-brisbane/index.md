In 2019 I [gave a talk](https://cartoonbeats.com/wordcamp-brisbane-talk-cool-stuff-inside-gutenberg/) at my first ever [WordCamp](https://central.wordcamp.org) (in Brisbane). Looking back I'm feeling lucky to have travelled and attended in person. Like so many other communities, WordCamps are now pretty much 100% online &amp; distributed.

Whenever I find myself in a new place there are a couple of things that I'll typically do:

1. Wander around and look at buildings and other urban scenery.
2. Explore an art gallery, ideally full of contemporary work.
3. Find a local club with DJs or live music and see what's on.

## QAGOMA

In Brisbane there is a fantastic art gallery - [QAGOMA](https://www.qagoma.qld.gov.au). I think I spent a solid morning there and then went back to co-work in the cafe, riverside, the following day.

Not only is QAGOMA chock-full of contemporary art; the building and grounds is an archetypal demonstration of modernist concrete, hedges, sculpture and lawn working in harmony. It's like walking around a two-point perspective tech-drawing artist's impression of the future, and I love it ðŸ‘Œ

## Daniel Crooks

Work from a fellow New Zealander - **[Daniel Crooks](http://danielcrooks.com)** â€“ immediately grabbed me, early in my visit.

(Side note: I'm grateful to Australia's larger economy and mineral wealth for helping develop and promote so many creative Kiwis.)

Daniel Crooks is not a painter; he works with moving images. I'm always interested to see what artists do with motion or video, and how they can transcend the standard formats (e.g. rectangular, linear film).

### Train no. 1

The first work I saw was *[Train no. 1](https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/342.2005.a-c/)*, an ultra-wide format video work. A shot of a train platform is stretched across multiple screens in a technique that looks like a visual analogue of [audio timestretching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_time_stretching_and_pitch_scaling).

The video is sliced up horizontally into windows, and multiple similar windows are laid out horizontally, producing repetitions of bits of action across the frame, reminiscent of [audio delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)). Anyone who's heard my music or me DJing knows that I'm pretty obsessed by [dub delay](https://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/dub-mixing). I'm experimenting with [GLSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language) [shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com) in an attempt to build a shader which simulates this effect.

### Phantom Ride

Crooks' [Phantom Ride](https://www.movingimagecommission.org.au/the-commissions/daniel-crooks-phantom-ride/) was running in the next room. This is a much larger, two-screen installation. And a much richer work, with beautiful hi-definition photography of urban and countryside scenery with one common element throughout â€“ railway lines, and the unstoppable, continuous progression of time.

I draw a parallel between this work and music, carving up time into chunks and sections (verse, chorus, bridge) while maintaining a common rhythm across the changes. I also loved that such a simple technique and idea could produce such a powerful, meditative space, and that the work could be looped infinitely without appearing as such - make the temporal edits (or, the frame) an integral part of the work.

The accompanying musical score is by **[Byron Scullin](http://byronscullin.com)**. The music plays a huge role in the contemplative nature of the piece. To me this is an audiovisual work realised by a collaboration, though I could imagine that the ideas and themes are driven by Crooks. I'll have to seek out more sound from Scullin and hear what he's all about. *[Bass Bath](http://byronscullin.com/bass-bath-1)* sounds intriguing!

I was grabbed by lots of the work on display â€“ here are some photos of other highlights!
