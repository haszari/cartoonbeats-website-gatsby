Anunaku – Teleported

If you read this blog you might already know I like taking photos of [tiles](https://cartoonbeats.com/page-soundtrack-demo/dub-techno-tiles/). This post is about another photographic hobby of mine – manhole covers.

Here's one from Amsterdam which (to my eyes) evokes a computer keyboard. I did a quick google to find out what *[Purator](https://www.environmental-expert.com/companies/purator-wallner-neubert-umwelttechnik-gmbh-10246)* is - and found a [website devoted to manhole covers](https://manhole.co.il/coverDetails.asp?c=1128)!

Herzel – Glide

So far, the Czech Republic is winning – two manhole covers of note. I think this one is from the quad inside [Prague Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Castle).

CYRK – Memorial

<!-- /wp:soundtrack/loop -->

This one's just a regular manhole from a random street in Prague, but it's a damn cool design, especially against the backdrop of the concentric intersected rings of the pavement.

Noir – Disruption

Actually it looks like the USA (or LA to be precise) is a close second, though the manhole covers aren't nearly as interesting. This one's a pretty great nod to futuristic 80s vector art.

That one looks more square than the others. I heard that ["Why are manhole covers round?"](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/60929/why-are-manhole-covers-round) is an interview question at Microsoft. I feel like this is the one question I wouldn't have a problem with.

Shedbug – There's Hope for You Yet

<!-- /wp:soundtrack/loop -->

This one here is not really noteworthy, except for the clear pride that LA has that this manhole cover was made in India.

Wyatt Marshall – This &amp; That

Nothing to say about this one from Canada, except that the sun was nice and low when I took the photo.
