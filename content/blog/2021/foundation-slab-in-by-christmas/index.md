A couple of months ago, on the drive back from Kaka Point, a cyclic melody came into my head. This happens sometimes, when my mind is free-wheeling, in the groove of driving.

Although I claim to be a dedicated hobby musician, the amount of "music" (melodic material) that I "write" is pretty small these days. So I seized on this opportunity - i.e. asked Jill to record me singing the tune (with my phone.

We were driving back from one of our infrequent trips to [check  progress on our build](https://taratakaka.wordpress.com). The progress this time involved one of the most wonderful materials in this world – cast concrete. We had a foundation!

I've always loved dub and I'm starting to get a better feel for producing it ([see also Redline Train](https://cartoonbeats.com/product/redline-train/)).

As soon as we arrived home, I hid in my office and kept dragging notes &amp; twiddling knobs in [Bitwig](https://www.bitwig.com) until I had the bones (foundation!) of a new reggae tune.

Cut to mid-december and a call on a [Dunedin Music group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/116402411773825): *who wants to contribute some original, non-vocal, somewhat electronic music for a christmas compilation?* 

**I do!**

I hastily tracked down a [free sleigh bells sample](https://freesound.org/people/soundstack/sounds/255104/) and wrapped the tune, just in time for christmas.
