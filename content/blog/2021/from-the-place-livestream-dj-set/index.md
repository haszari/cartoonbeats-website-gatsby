Had an extremely fun time throwing down a minimix DJ set for [From the Place](https://fromtheplace.fun). Thanks to Personn Wil for wrangling this splendid *Space Concert* (in stereo) – I have definitely never seen a livestream like this!

Here's the tracklist. I wanted to play a bunch of my original stuff (some from the unreleased vault) also some rave flavours that I'm feeling right now.

1. Haszari - Hoiximino Paad Tool
2. Haszari - Eggs for Tea
3. Paranoid London - Eating Glue
4. Haszari - Granite Countertops (aka Qolasoo)
5. ZZT - Vulkan Alarm!
6. Haszari - Shed Out
7. Interplanetary Criminal - Supreme Level
8. Subb-an - Sunrise Mood
9. Len Faki - Street Dub (Version)
10. Haszari - Other People Are Having Breakfast
11. Soft Tigers - Mr Ice Cream (Waxmaster rework)
12. Overmono - BMW Track
13. Kidz In Space - Downtime (Haszari's Uptime reedit)
14. Kevin Knapp - Miss Me
15. Haszari - Padded Cell
16. Haszari - Hysibe Synth Tool

[You can check out the set on Facebook](https://fb.watch/7OE3QTIboS/) – not sure where else it's available (yet). Look forward to the next one!
