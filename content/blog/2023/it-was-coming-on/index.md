*It Was Coming On* is built around a [public domain sample of a journalist interviewing people on the street](https://www.loc.gov/item/afc1941004_sr02/), after the Pearl Harbour attack that kicked off World War Two.

I flipped this somewhat dark sample material into a vocal for a playful, energetic and surreal tech-house tune with a bouncy groove.

Today I celebrated the release by heading up to [Radio 1 for a chat with Candi on breakfast](https://www.r1.co.nz/podcasts)! Full audio interview on their [podcasts page](https://www.r1.co.nz/podcasts).

The cover art is cropped from street art on a temporary fence by [Lund building](https://www.google.com/maps/@-45.8778712,170.5065097,3a,75y,159.15h,90.22t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sW8vZfnQ8iNcc0TRIH4bqSw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) on Dunedin industrial waterfront. I don't know who the artist is â€“ if you recognise this eye, send me a message!

Side note, also in that area is a wonderful concrete tile one-off street sculpture by **[Levi Hawken](https://www.levihawken.com/)**.
