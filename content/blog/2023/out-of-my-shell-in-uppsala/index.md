I normally take a couple of days to come out of my shell after travelling. When I land I need sleep, downtime, a supermarket for supplies.

I don’t usually take many photos until I’m ready. Sometimes something grabs me though.

It's similar for holidays and weekends. During the working week I have lots of ideas and things I want to follow up. Then when I have free time, I struggle with the balance between free-wheeling downtime and productive busy downtime.

So here I am walking around Uppsala at the start of my [3-month sabbatical](https://automattic.com/benefits/). Facing an epic amount of downtime!

So it was nice when this dark wee character stared me down in the alley and started pulling me out of my shell.
