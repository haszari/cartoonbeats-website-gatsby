While I'm in Europe I want to check out raves &amp; clubs and generally get a feel for the scene over here – where it's all happening!

Here in Stockholm, [Trädgården](https://www.tradgarden.com/) is running [daytime sessions](http://daytimesessions.com/) – ideal as I'm off to Berlin tomorrow. Even better, **[Skin on Skin](https://www.stayonsight.com/)** is playing – you might have heard his classic *Don't Fuck Around* on [Beats Reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cievHQoUTM).

[Trädgården](https://www.tradgarden.com/) is pretty amazing and right up my alley – it's an outdoor club, under a motorway flyover, at the bottom of Södermalm (island in the middle of Stockholm). It's like a festival – bars everywhere, multiple stages (only one going for this event), green walls, inflatable pegasuses, grandstand seating.

The vibe was pure techno – energetic, the archetypal rave sound. **Daniel Berj**, **Dissolver** (live set), **Skin on Skin**, and **Mama Snake**. I was busy checking out contemporary art so arrived close to the end of **Dissolver**'s  set.

**Skin on Skin** played a blinder of a set, high-energy rave techno and a bit of a ghetto tech vibe at times too. He played a few tunes I recognised and I couldn't help pull out the camera. Let the record show I danced much more than I filmed!

**Mama Snake** played more of a tech-trance set and was generally all class – smooth mixes and a constant unrelenting groove.

And – yes, there was a [technoviking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno_Viking) / energetic shirtless dude permanently anchored to the front of the dancefloor.
