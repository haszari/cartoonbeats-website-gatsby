Based on actual events! A recreation of my set at [Dunedin Winter Solstice](https://www.facebook.com/events/3668783623437713). Not exactly the same set but mostly the same tracks in mostly the same order.

The set was performed as a livestream throwdown for a [social activity at my work](https://kirstenclacey.com/2023/07/06/intentional-random-connections/). Everyone in the company is distributed around the globe, so occasionally [we run a 24-hour "intentional connections" day](https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/02/09/an-open-source-approach-to-creating-company-events/), with lots of livestreams and virtual hangouts.

With this set I wanted to use a few of [my](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0hGwn4tIEtJXtzLF9Uihy5) own tracks as waypoints, and connect them with other music that I really love right now. My taste, my production, and my DJ sets are quite eclectic – you can't pin me down! So it felt really satisfying when this came together as a cohesive whole.

Stick around to the end for a preview of my upcoming release "Gumdrop", out on 25 July everywhere.
